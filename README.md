=========

Wiresnark¹ is a [PacketFu](https://github.com/todb/packetfu)-inspired and [PcapRub](https://github.com/shadowbq/pcaprub)-based packet generator/monitor, written for the purpose of testing (hopefully – not only) [NetFPGA](http://netfpga.org)-based network hardware for the [Future Internet Engineering](https://www.iip.net.pl/en/project) project.
